# Benchmarks

This section provides comprehensive performance benchmarks comparing SLAF against traditional and modern single-cell data formats and dataloaders.

### **Comprehensive Benchmarks**

- **[For Bioinformaticians](bioinformatics_benchmarks.md)** - Detailed benchmarks for common bioinformatics operations including cell/gene filtering, expression queries, and preprocessing pipelines
- **[For ML Engineers](ml_benchmarks.md)** - Performance analysis for machine learning workflows, dataloader throughput, and GPU training preparation

### **Format Comparisons**

- **[SLAF vs h5ad](slaf_vs_h5ad_benchmarks.md)** - Performance comparison against the traditional AnnData format
- **[SLAF vs TileDB](slaf_vs_tiledb_benchmarks.md)** - Comparison with modern cloud-native storage alternatives.
