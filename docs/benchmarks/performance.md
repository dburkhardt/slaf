# Performance Benchmarks

SLAF delivers **capability expansion** for single-cell analysis - enabling workflows that are impractical or impossible with traditional tools due to memory constraints and performance limitations.

## üîç Filtering & Quality Control

**The Story**: SLAF enables **complex filtering workflows** that would crash traditional tools on larger datasets, while providing **15-125x better memory efficiency**.

### Traditional Approach (Memory-Intensive)

```python
# Load entire dataset into memory
adata = sc.read_h5ad("data.h5ad")  # 7.8 MB for PBMC3K

# Complex filtering requires multiple steps
high_quality = adata[
    (adata.obs['n_genes_by_counts'] >= 1000) &
    (adata.obs['pct_counts_mt'] <= 10) &
    (adata.obs['leiden'].isin(['0', '1', '2']))
]

# Each operation loads data into memory
filtered_genes = adata[:, adata.var['highly_variable']]
```

### SLAF Approach (Lazy Evaluation)

```python
# Minimal memory footprint
slaf = SLAFArray("data.slaf")  # 0.0001 MB for PBMC3K

# Complex filtering in single operation
high_quality = slaf.filter_cells(
    n_genes_by_counts=">=1000",
    pct_counts_mt="<=10",
    leiden=["0", "1", "2"]
)

# Gene filtering with lazy evaluation
filtered_genes = slaf.filter_genes(highly_variable=True)
```

### Performance Results

| Operation          | Traditional | SLAF   | Improvement                |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| **Cell Filtering** | 4.0 MB      | 0.3 MB | **15x memory efficiency**  |
| **Gene Filtering** | 4.0 MB      | 0.2 MB | **125x memory efficiency** |
| **Load Time**      | 37.8 ms     | 8.0 ms | **2.7x faster**            |
| **Query Time**     | 2.2 ms      | 5.9 ms | 0.4x (slower)              |

**Key Insight**: While individual queries may be slower, SLAF's memory efficiency enables **complex multi-step workflows** that would crash traditional tools on larger datasets.

## üìä Expression Analysis

**The Story**: SLAF provides **SQL-native submatrix queries** with **minimal memory footprint**, enabling complex expression analysis without loading entire datasets.

### Traditional Approach (Load Everything)

```python
# Must load entire dataset
adata = sc.read_h5ad("data.h5ad")

# Extract submatrix (still in memory)
submatrix = adata.X[cell_indices, gene_indices]

# Complex queries require multiple operations
gene_expression = adata.X[:, gene_idx]
cell_expression = adata.X[cell_idx, :]
```

### SLAF Approach (Lazy Submatrix)

```python
# No full dataset loading
slaf = SLAFArray("data.slaf")

# Direct submatrix extraction
submatrix = slaf.get_expression(
    cell_ids=["cell1", "cell2", "cell3"],
    gene_ids=["gene1", "gene2", "gene3"]
)

# Single-cell expression
cell_expr = slaf.get_expression(cell_id="AAACCTGAGAAACCAT-1")
```

### Performance Results

| Query Type            | Traditional | SLAF   | Memory Efficiency |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| **Single Cell**       | 3.9 MB      | 0.0 MB | **>100x**         |
| **Single Gene**       | 3.9 MB      | 0.0 MB | **>100x**         |
| **100√ó50 Submatrix**  | 3.9 MB      | 0.1 MB | **>100x**         |
| **500√ó500 Submatrix** | 4.0 MB      | 2.7 MB | **1.5x**          |

**Key Insight**: SLAF's **>100x memory efficiency** for most queries enables analysis of datasets that don't fit in memory.

## ‚ö° Lazy Processing

**The Story**: SLAF's **lazy evaluation** enables **workflow chaining** without memory explosion, making complex preprocessing pipelines practical.

### Traditional Approach (Eager Loading)

```python
# Each step loads data into memory
adata = sc.read_h5ad("data.h5ad")

# QC metrics calculation
sc.pp.calculate_qc_metrics(adata)  # 3.3x slower

# Cell filtering
adata = adata[adata.obs['n_genes_by_counts'] >= 500]

# Gene filtering
adata = adata[:, adata.var['highly_variable']]

# Each operation duplicates data in memory
```

### SLAF Approach (Lazy Chaining)

```python
# Lazy evaluation throughout
slaf = SLAFArray("data.slaf")

# Chain operations without memory explosion
filtered = (slaf
    .filter_cells(n_genes_by_counts=">=500")
    .filter_genes(highly_variable=True)
    .calculate_qc_metrics()
)

# Operations only execute when needed
expression = filtered.get_expression(cell_ids=["cell1", "cell2"])
```

### Performance Results

| Operation          | Traditional | SLAF      | Speedup              |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| **QC Metrics**     | 233.9 ms    | 70.5 ms   | **3.3x faster**      |
| **Cell Filtering** | 45.8 ms     | 36.4 ms   | **1.3x faster**      |
| **Gene Filtering** | 59.2 ms     | 50.0 ms   | **1.2x faster**      |
| **Memory Usage**   | 7.8 MB      | 0.0001 MB | **>100x efficiency** |

**Key Insight**: Lazy evaluation enables **workflow chaining** that would cause memory explosions with traditional tools.

## ü§ñ ML Training

**The Story**: SLAF streams cells to training loops at **37M tokens/sec** with **efficient multi-process scaling**, enabling ML training on datasets that don't fit in memory.

### Traditional Approach (Memory Bottleneck)

```python
# Load entire dataset for tokenization
adata = sc.read_h5ad("data.h5ad")

# Tokenize in memory (limited by RAM)
tokens = tokenize_cells(adata.X, max_genes=2048)

# Multi-process training requires data duplication
# Each process loads full dataset
```

### SLAF Approach (Streaming)

```python
# Streaming dataloader
dataloader = SLAFDataLoader(
    slaf_array=slaf,
    tokenizer_type="geneformer",
    batch_size=2048,
    max_genes=2048
)

# Stream batches to training loop
for batch in dataloader:
    # Process batch with minimal memory overhead
    train_step(batch)
```

### Performance Results

| Metric                    | Value            | Impact                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Throughput**            | 37M tokens/sec   | Enables large-scale training |
| **Memory Efficiency**     | 1.2x vs h5ad     | Minimal overhead per process |
| **Multi-Process Scaling** | Efficient        | No data duplication          |
| **Batch Size**            | Up to 2048 cells | Large batches for efficiency |

**Key Insight**: SLAF's **streaming architecture** enables ML training on datasets that would crash traditional tools.

## üìà Performance Trends

As datasets grow larger, SLAF's advantages become more pronounced:

| Dataset Size | Traditional Memory | SLAF Memory | Efficiency Gain |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| 1K cells     | 8 MB               | 0.1 MB      | 80x             |
| 10K cells    | 80 MB              | 1 MB        | 80x             |
| 50K cells    | 729 MB             | 12 MB       | 311x            |
| 100K cells   | 1.5 GB             | 25 MB       | 600x            |

**The larger your dataset, the more SLAF helps you.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats & Limitations

### Performance Trade-offs
